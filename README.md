# EnglishWritingInViews

An application for learning English that checks your answers to the questions,
highlights mistakes in the text and helps you to correct them.

The technology and instruments stack I used in developing the application:

- Kotlin
- MVVM
- ViewModel
- Clean Architecture
- Flow
- Room
- Retrofit
- Coroutines
- Jetpack Navigation
- Hilt
- Firebase authentication
- Junit
- MockK
- OneSignal

An example of how the application works:
